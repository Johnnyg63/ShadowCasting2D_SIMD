# ShadowCasting2D_SIMD
Executes the OneLoneCoder ShadowCastine2D using SIMD

There are two demos you can download and compare the speed and power of SIMD (Neon (ARM) coming soon). These are Shadow Casting applications. 
Shadow casting is a pain, and it uses a lot of resources for it to work property, so what better way to test SIMD, right? 
The first demo is ShadowCast2D, you can download the demo here. This Shadow Caster was created by OneLoneCoder, a long time ago, and it is an amazing shadow caster application, beautifully written to be honest. You can watch the video here.
The second demo is ShadowCast2D_SIMD, you can download the demo here. This is the exact same project as ShadowCast2D except the draw routines have been replaced with SIMD methods
